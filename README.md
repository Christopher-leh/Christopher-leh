## Hi there 👋

I'm a mathematics student in my master's program at OTH Regensburg.  
My academic and practical interests are moving increasingly toward

- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Numerical Methods & Scientific Computing

## Current Focus

- beginning my master's studies in *Mathematics for Business and Industry*  
- deepening my understanding of neural networks and computer vision  
- working on practical ML projects in Python  

## Projects

- **Fluid Simulation in Python**  
  A 2D numerical solver for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (semi-Lagrangian advection, FFT-based projection).

  - **Bias Correction of Regional Climate Models using Neural Networks** 
  Applying machine learning methods to reduce systematic errors in climate model outputs.

- **CNN-Based Binary Segmentation** *(upcoming)*  
  Building and training convolutional neural networks for pixel-wise segmentation tasks.
